# Corgi

An ncurses corgi runs across the screen.

Developed for Jolie Chen's birthday (3/16/2013) in the day before.

# Install

The Makefile (small) will put the binary in `/usr/local/bin`.

If on OS X

`make install`

On Ubuntu (and many similar distributions of Linux), root is necessary
to place the binary.

`sudo make install`
